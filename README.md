 # Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch and NumPy

This project aims to provide a Python tool for generating semantic segmentation maps of images using PyTorch and NumPy. Semantic segmentation is the process of assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, thus dividing the image into regions of interest. This tool utilizes deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch for efficient and accurate segmentation.

## Features

- **Semantic Segmentation**: Generate pixel-level segmentation maps for input images.
- **PyTorch Integration**: Leveraging the power of PyTorch for deep learning-based segmentation.
- **Efficient Processing**: Utilizes NumPy for efficient array manipulation and processing.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily swap and customize segmentation models to suit specific needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy integration into existing projects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-segmentation.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use this tool for semantic segmentation:

1. Import the necessary modules:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import torch
    from segmentation_model import SegmentationModel
    ```

2. Load the segmentation model:

    ```python
    model = SegmentationModel()
    ```

3. Load the image to be segmented:

    ```python
    image = np.load('input_image.npy')
    ```

4. Perform segmentation:

    ```python
    segmentation_map = model.segment(image)
    ```

5. Save or visualize the segmentation map:

    ```python
    np.save('segmentation_map.npy', segmentation_map)
    ```
